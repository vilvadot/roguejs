## Ideas ðŸ’¡

- Player starts in safe camp
- When you venture in any direction you visit a random map
    - Maps persist during a whole cycle

- You can reset a cycle by sleeping in the camp
    - Sleeping restores all of your health
    - Sleeping restores your bolt count
    - With each reset you have a chance of a blowout.

- There might be anomalies on maps. An anomaly is invisible until you step on it
    - You can trigger it, or part of it by throwing a bolt
    - Limited number of bolts

- You can find loot around the maps

- You will face enemies of different kinds around the maps

- You can view the path you already walked on a map (useful to traverse anomalies)

- Blowouts
    - Reset known maps / paths

- You can return at any time to the camp to sell the stuff you found
    - You can buy upgrades / gear with the coin you get
