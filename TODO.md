## TODO 🛠

- Enemy:
    x Don't step on player
    x Don't step on obstacles
    - Don't step on other enemies
    - Follow player only if player in FOV
    - Avoid obstacles by pathfinding

## Concerns ⚠️

- Using raw positions everywhere
- Tiles and their position are not tied together
- Display is not encapsulated

## Thoughts 🧠
- I it worth it migrating to Typescript?
