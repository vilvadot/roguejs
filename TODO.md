## Ideas ðŸ’¡

x Player starts in safe camp
x When you venture in any direction you visit a random map
x Maps persist during a whole cycle

- You can reset a cycle by sleeping in the camp
  - Sleeping restores all of your health
  - Sleeping restores your bolt count
  - With each reset you have a chance of a blowout.

x There might be anomalies on maps. An anomaly is invisible until you step on it

- You can trigger it, or part of it by throwing a bolt
- Limited number of bolts

- You can find loot around the maps
  x You will face enemies of different kinds around the maps
  x You can view the path you already walked on a map (useful to traverse anomalies)

- Blowouts
  - Reset known maps / paths

x You can return at any time to the camp to sell the stuff you found
x You can buy upgrades / gear with the coin you get
